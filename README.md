# **Readme for Variable Swap Program**

## **Description:**
The Variable Swap program is a Fortran program designed to swap the values of two variables, 'x' and 'y.' The user is prompted to input values for 'x' and 'y,' and the program performs the swapping operation, displaying the updated values.

## **Usage:**
1. Run the program by executing the provided Fortran code.
2. Input values for 'x' and 'y' when prompted.
3. The program will swap the values of 'x' and 'y' and display the updated values.

## **Note:**
- The program uses a temporary variable 'z' to facilitate the swap.
- After the swap operation, the program prints the updated values of 'x' and 'y.'

## **Example:**
```fortran
Enter values for x and y below:
5 10
The values you entered for x and y have been interchanged as (x, y) = 10 5
```

## **About:**
The Variable Swap Program demonstrates a basic operation of swapping values between variables. It provides an example of using a temporary variable to exchange the values of two variables.
